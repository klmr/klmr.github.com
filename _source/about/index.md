<section>
I’m a postdoctoral researcher at the [University of Cambridge][] &
[EMBL][]-[EBI][]. I analyse genomic data to answer biological questions. Here
are some of the things I’ve been up to:

# Research

My current work is on the regulation of translation in mammals through changes
in tRNA abundance and codon usage. I am also looking at the extended polymerase
III transcriptome, in particular SINEs. My [PhD thesis][] was titled
*“Investigating the link between tRNA and mRNA abundance in mammals”*.

Before this, I’ve worked in algorithms and software development, in particular
implementing high-throughput sequencing read mapping tools, and creating
frameworks for the automatic parallelisation of high-performance code on
multicore architecture. I have also done work in cell regulatory networks using
Petri nets.

# Hacking

I’m the developer of ‹[modules][]›, an alternative [R][] code modularisation
system. It replaces conventional R packages and fixes [some of its
flaws][modules-rationale]. The mechanism is borrowed from Python packages and
JavaScript modules.

I developed the first version of the [LaTeX][] package ‹[minted][]›, which
provides code pretty-printing by wrapping [Pygments][].

I strive to make development with [C++][] less painful by showcasing the use of
clean, high-level code over low-level constructs. [C++11][] has made this
immensely easier.
